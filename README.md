# Run Tracker Client

## Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript
Jquery
AJAX

## App Description:

As the name implies, this is a simple RunTracker Single Page Application(SPA).
The app enables runners to track their run history. The API stores data pertaining
to how many miles the users has run and and how many minutes the user has ran for.
New users must create an account to sign in.  Once signed in, users can create
a run, update a run, delete a run, and view all past runs.  They can also perform
very exciting tasks like signing out and changing their password.

## Planning

In regards to planning, I used a website that I liked the style of, as a
general guidepost for how I wanted the finished website to look.  I used my wire frame
and user stories in the early stages of development, but, as the project went on,
I primarily followed the suggested schedule to keep me on track.

## Development Process
For the client side, as I previously stated, I started with the wire frame and user
stories so I had a general idea of where I was going.  After deploying to GitHub and
setting up the API, I set up the sign-up, sign-in, change password, + signout authorization.
I think the biggest obstacle I ran into on the front-end was trying to use handlebars
to display all my resources on the webpage. I was able to see the resources in the
console, but getting them displayed on the page was tougher than anticipated.

Once that was resolved and I had achieved basic functionality, I debugged the front end
and focused on making the site more visually pleasing with Bootstrap.  I made the
decision to place the forms within the nav bar because I thought it looked better and
was an easier experience for the user.  Overall, I'm very pleased with how the front
end turned out from a functionality and user-friendliness standpoint.

## Unsolved Problems
If I have more time to work on the project, I'd like to add additional features, such
as: sorting by most recent run, the ability to see your average time, the ability to
see your personal records and how much you ran in the last week, month, year, etc.

## User Stories
User Stories
-As a new user, I would like to be able to create an account and sign in, so that I can begin to use app and add my Runs.
-As an authorized user, I would like to be able to create new Runs, see all my past Runs, update previous Runs, and delete past Runs if necessary.
-As an authorized user, I would like to use the app to see the distance, time, and frequency of previous runs.
-As an authorized user, it would be nice to have the ability to sort previous ratings from longest duration to quickest time per mile.
-As a user, I would like a sleek, minimalistic design.
